Elijah is curently holding a position on the board for one of the largest Hispanic clubs on campus which is the Latinx Cultural Association and is in the running for President next school year. Coming from an immigrant family, there is the push to make his families sacrifices all worth it and become a role model for those Mexican-American individuals him so that they may see that they too can make it. 

Reasearch Aspirations: 

When it comes to research, I would really enjoy doing something with organic chemistry as I find the subject extremely interesting. The staff is also amazing and so passionate about their work which makes the work being done that much more interesting. I am also looking into the newly created SACNAS community and the work that they may be doing here in the near future. Please feel free to reach out with any open positions or interest forms and I will always answer as soon as possible.
